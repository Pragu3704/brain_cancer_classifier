# Brain cancer classifier

Brain cancers are one of the most lethal cancers out there known to man. It is characterised by the abnormal growth of cells, which could be glial or non-glial cells, in the regions surrounding or interior of the brain environment. The cancers remain extremely difficult to treat. The gold standard for the diagnosis of brain cancer is through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. 

With the advent of deep learning architectures, their implementation into the field of medical imaging is a key requirement of the present time. Human errors during diagnosis remain one the most common causes of bad treatment outcomes and error-related deaths. Despite the high-resolution images produced by the latest machines, there is still a possibility of overlooking diffused areas where cancer could have spread or defining proper contours to establish tumour boundaries, which becomes incredibly important during surgical procedures. Deep learning networks such as CNNs have shown excellent promise the the field of disease diagnosis, in being able to capture details to great precision. This project aims to take baby-steps into exploring the application of deep neural networks in the field of medical image analysis.

The dataset for this project was derived from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri)
